# cacheMAST
CacheMAST (Cache Management Analysis and Visualisation Tool) is a tool designed to visualise cache management strategies across a content delivery chain for network and communications researchers and engineers. The tool helps simplify the analysis of how caching choices impact the usage of network and cache infrastructure resources, with the goal of giving a visual insight into the design of appropriate strategies for optimised content delivery. 

The tool allows the user to:
- Import and modify network topologies with varying cache and link capacities.
- Configure network nodes and links with variable administrative costs and caching capabilities.
- Simulate content delivery scenarios using various configuration settings.
- Visualise simulation results and statistics and export these in a standard format for future use.

The code will be made available soon.
